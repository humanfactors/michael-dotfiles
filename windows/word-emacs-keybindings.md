# Emacs Keybindings for Microsoft Word

Below are basic keybindings for word to allow emacs-like keyboard navigations. It's important to
note that I overwrite a few in built shortcuts - but most of these have alternatives or are just as
easily rebound. As you fill them word will prompt you to change these settings.
