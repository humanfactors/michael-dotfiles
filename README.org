* Michael's Dotfiles

Very opinionated and quite customised dotfiles. Includes customisation and centered around:

- Spacemacs/Emacs
- oh-my-zsh
- Gnome
- tmux
- Linux utilities

** Spacemacs Configuration
[[file:docs/spacemacs-editing-style-hybrid.png]]
My spacemacs configuration is broken down into several modules which are loaded in my Spacemacs =init.el=. Most of the functionality from these can be loaded directly into a standard Emacs 25 install - though this does require some manual steps. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (file-readable-p "~/.spacemacs.d/gui-interaction.el") (load "~/.spacemacs.d/gui-interaction.el"))
  (if (file-readable-p "~/.spacemacs.d/keybinds.el") (load "~/.spacemacs.d/keybinds.el"))
  (if (file-readable-p "~/.spacemacs.d/modes-config.el") (load "~/.spacemacs.d/modes-config.el"))
  (if (file-readable-p "~/.spacemacs.d/org-config.el") (load "~/.spacemacs.d/org-config.el"))
#+END_SRC
